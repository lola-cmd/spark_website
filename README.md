# spark_website
In one of our university courses we have a task to add some extra functions to a drone simulation. Our group have decided to simulate the drones to send out a heart defibrillator to a person calling the emergency using the location data of the callers phone. One part of this goal is to create a webpage that the caller will view when clicking on a link to share the location data. I was assigned this task. Furthermore, the creation of this website is a learning experience of html and css for myself.
